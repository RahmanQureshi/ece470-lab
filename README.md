E470 Labs 3 and 4

This repository contains the (completed) labs 3 and 4 for ECE470 to control a KUKA KR6 R700 sixx robotic arm. The culmination of lab 3 was drawing a picture and the culmination of lab 4 was moving an object from one location to another while avoiding obstacles. A video demonstration of lab 4 can be found on my [website]
